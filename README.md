ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Iâ€™m **Razvan** (@razvanwir) â€” **a tech enthusiast at the beginning of my journey**, fueled by curiosity and a hunger to learn. Iâ€™m diving headfirst into cybersecurity, automation, and software development, one line of code at a time.  

### ðŸŒ± Growing My Skills In...  
- **Languages & Tools**: Python | Docker | SQL  
- **Cybersecurity Toolkit**: Hands-on with SQLiPy (SQL injection testing), vulnerability scanning, and secure coding practices.  
- **Automation Playground**: Building simple scripts to solve real-world puzzles.  

### ðŸ§  Learning Mindset  
- **Embrace the Grind**: No challenge is too smallâ€”every error is a lesson.  
- **Ask, Experiment, Repeat**: Obsessed with understanding the "why" behind tools and techniques.  
- **Open Source Newbie**: Contributing to small projects to sharpen my craft.  

### ðŸŽ§ Beyond the Keyboard  
When Iâ€™m not wrestling with code, Iâ€™m:  
- Blasting bass-heavy beats to stay motivated.  
- Trying CTF challenges (and celebrating small wins!).
